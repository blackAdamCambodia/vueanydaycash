              <p>
                Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider
                other alternatives or should seek out professional financial
                advice.

                This website is not an offer to lend. AnyDayCash.com is not a
                lender or lending partner and does not make loan or credit
                decisions. AnyDayCash.com connects interested persons with a
                lender or lending partner from its network of approved lenders
                and lending partners. AnyDayCash.com does not control and is not
                responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender or
                lending partner, is not an agent, representative or broker of
                any lender or lending partner, and does not endorse any lender
                or lending partner. AnyDayCash.com receives compensation from
                its lenders and lending partners, often based on a ping-tree
                model similar to Google AdWords where the highest available
                bidder is connected to the consumer. Regardless,
                AnyDayCash.com’s service is always free to you. In some cases,
                you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal
                lender. Tribal lenders are subject to tribal and certain federal
                laws while being immune from state law including usury caps. If
                you are connected to a tribal lender, please understand that the
                tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed
                lenders. Additionally, tribal lenders may require you to agree
                to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. You are urged
                to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any
                lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any
                particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that
                includes terms that are not acceptable to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                This service is not available in all states. If you request to
                connect with a lender or lending partner in a particular state
                where such loans are prohibited, or in a location where
                AnyDayCash.com does not have an available lender or lending
                partner, you will not be connected to a lender or lending
                partner. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any
                loan offered by any lender or lending partner, and to reject any
                particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that
                includes terms that are not acceptable to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                By submitting your information via this website, you are
                authorizing AnyDayCash.com and its partners to do a credit
                check, which may include verifying your social security number,
                driver license number or other identification, and a review of
                your creditworthiness. Credit checks are usually performed by
                one of the major credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax and
                TransUnion, but also may include alternative credit bureaus such
                as Teletrack, DP Bureau or others. You also authorize
                AnyDayCash.com to share your information and credit history with
                a network of approved lenders and lending partners.

              <h3>Lender’s or Lending Partner’s Disclosure of Terms.</h3>
              <p>
                The lenders and lending partners you are connected to will
                provide documents that contain all fees and rate information
                pertaining to the loan being offered, including any potential
                fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be
                allowed (if permitted by applicable law) to refinance, renew or
                rollover your loan. Loan fees and interest rates are determined
                solely by the lender or lending partner based on the lender’s or
                lending partner’s internal policies, underwriting criteria and
                applicable law. AnyDayCash.com has no knowledge of or control
                over the loan terms offered by a lender and lending partner. You
                are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered
                by any lenders and lending partners and to reject any particular
                loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes
                terms that are not acceptable to you.
              </p>
              <h3>Late Payments Hurt Your Credit Score</h3>
              <p>
                Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment
                can negatively impact your credit score. To protect yourself and
                your credit history, make sure you only accept loan terms that
                you can afford to repay. If you cannot make a payment on time,
                you should contact your lenders and lending partners immediately
                and discuss how to handle late payments.
