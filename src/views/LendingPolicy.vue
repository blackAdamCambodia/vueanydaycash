              <h2>State Regulations</h2>
              <p>

                seeking, including the rules, regulations and laws that might
                apply to that loan and the lender or lending partner offering
                it.

              <h2>Truth in Lending Act (TILA)</h2>
              <p>

                details regarding your loan. This should be presented to you
                prior to any agreement being executed. lenders and lending
                partners may not offer terms that exceed any applicable laws,

              <h2>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act</h2>
              <p>
                The Dodd-Frank Act requires that all lenders and lending
                partners practice fair lending. The Act empowers the Consumer
                Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue regulations that
                prohibit abuse and unfair lending practices, which includes
                regulations designed to prevent disparities among consumers of
                equal creditworthiness but are of a different race, ethnicity,
                gender or age.

                Personal Information
              </h2>
              <p>
                Federal law requires lenders and lending partners and other
                financial institutions to know who they are working with. The
                law is designed to fight money laundering and funding of
                terrorist networks. Therefore, you may be required to provide
                your name, date of birth, address, your social security number
                and other information. Your lender or lending partner may ask
                you to provide a valid state or federal ID to verify your
                personal information.
