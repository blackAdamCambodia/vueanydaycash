              <p>
                AnyDayCash.com provides a marketplace service where your loan
                request is submitted to a network of reputable lenders. Our
                service is always free--there is never a cost to you for
                submitting an inquiry. Your lender will have its own rates and
                fees that will be provided to you before you accept the loan.
                AnyDayCash.com is not a lender and does not make credit
                decisions.

                New customers may have questions about AnyDayCash.com, which is
                why we have compiled the most common questions below. If you
                have a question that is not answered here, we are happy to
                answer your questions.

                If you have questions regarding a loan inquiry, approval, funded
                loan, payments or any other question about a particular loan,
                please contact your lender or lending partner directly. If you
                received a loan, you should already have the lender’s or lending
                partner’s contact information. Since we are not the lender or
                lending partner, we cannot answer questions about pending or
                approved loans.

                    The amount a lender or lending partner is willing to give
                    you depends on how the lender or lending partner evaluates a
                    number of factors, including your state of residence and
                    applicable legal restrictions (loans are not available in
                    all states). Many lenders or lending partners in our network
                    will loan between $100 and $5,000.

                    Once the lender or lending partner approves your loan and
                    you accept the loan terms, your loan will be deposited
                    directly in your bank account, usually as soon as the next
                    day.

                    Personal loans generally are offered for people with good
                    credit, although each lender or lending partner has its own
                    underwriting policies. An alternative for those with bad
                    credit may be to seek a short-term consumer loan. If we
                    cannot find a lender or lending partner that can offer you a
                    personal loan for the amount you requested, we will search
                    our network of short term lenders or lending partners to see
                    if we can find a short-term lender or lending partner for
                    you.

                    It should only take a few minutes to complete our secure
                    online form. After we receive your information, we
                    immediately start looking for a lender or lending partner
                    that is willing to work with you. You should have a response
                    from one of our lenders or lending partners within minutes.
                    Final approval and funding is often done in as little as 24
                    to 48 hours.

                    Some lenders or lending partners will ask for your
                    permission to access your information such as bank
                    statements or income verification online, saving you from
                    having to fax or email copies of those documents. However,
                    your lender or lending partner might need you to fax or
                    email a copy of your bank statement, paycheck stubs or other
                    information. If you do not have access to a scanner or
                    printer, consider visiting Office Max, Kinkos or another
                    office service provider. You should also have access to a
                    printer so you can print a copy of your loan agreement. If
                    you have questions after your loan is funded, you will need
                    your lender’s or lending partner’s contact information!

                    There is no cost to use AnyDayCash.com’s marketplace
                    service. The actual cost of your loan may vary by lender or
                    lending partner. You will be provided information on the
                    rates and fees before you accept the loan. Personal loans
                    are not designed as long term financial solutions but are
                    often less costly than late charges, NSF fees or reconnect
                    fees for overdue utilities. Please only accept a loan if you
                    believe you have the ability to repay it.

                    You may be allowed to secure more than one personal loan at
                    any given time, but this will depend on your state’s laws as
                    well as your lender’s or lending partner’s practices. If you
                    have an outstanding personal loan or other personal loan,
                    you should let your new lender or lending partner know about

                    If you have selected the convenient and secure ACH payment
                    option, your loan payment will be withdrawn from your bank
                    account on its due date. This option is designed for
                    convenience and helps you avoid potential late fees or
                    default! If you need an extension on your loan, please
                    contact your lender or lending partner before you miss a

                    The rules on extensions or “rollovers” varies among lenders
                    or lending partners and also may be regulated by state law.
                    Some states allow for multiple rollovers while others do not
                    allow it at all. If you need an extension on your loan, make
                    sure to contact your lender or lending partner before you
                    miss any payments. Most lenders or lending partners will
                    work with you to help you avoid missing payments or
                    defaulting on your loan.

                    If you can’t make your loan payments on time, you may be in
                    default of your loan obligations. Late payments and loan
                    defaults may adversely affect your credit and may make it
                    difficult to obtain future personal loans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you can’t make your payments on time, don’t ignore it!
                    Talk to your lender or lending partner ahead of time and see
                    what they can do to help you make the best of the situation.
